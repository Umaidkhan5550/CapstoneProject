# CapstoneProject
Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a bike-sharing dataset using PySpark. This involves understanding the dataset's structure, identifying key trends, calculating metrics like ride distribution and durations, and analyzing how factors such as temperature and holidays affect bike usage.
Benefits to the Industry:
The insights gained from this project can help bike-sharing companies optimize their services, improve operational efficiency, and better understand user behavior. By analyzing ride patterns, member preferences, and environmental factors like temperature, companies can make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experience, allocate resources more effectively, and develop targeted marketing strategies.
Python Libraries Used:
PySpark: For distributed data processing and analysis.
SQL functions (e.g., avg, when, col): To perform aggregation, filtering, and transformations on data.
Target Audience:
This project is aimed at data analysts, data scientists, and business intelligence teams working in the transportation or urban mobility sectors. It is also relevant to anyone involved in the management of bike-sharing services or those interested in learning about the application of PySpark for big data analysis.
